**Bare-metal blockchain RPC infrastructure.**  
Built for reliability, not hype.

## What is z-node?

znode builds **production-grade blockchain infrastructure**
for teams running real-world, high-throughput workloads.

We focus on **stability, predictable performance, and operational correctness**
instead of shared cloud abstractions and best-effort guarantees.

### What we build

- Bare-metal blockchain RPC nodes
- Network-specific performance optimisations
- Dedicated infrastructure for critical workloads

### Why znode?

Most RPC providers optimise for convenience and scale.
We optimise for **correctness, latency, and uptime**.

If your business depends on blockchain infrastructure,
"good enough" is not good enough.

### Network focus

We start with **TRON** — a high-volume, operationally fragile network
often treated as a second-class citizen by generic providers.

At znode, TRON is first-class.

 ### Who this is for

- Crypto payment providers
- Exchanges and custodians
- Stablecoin-heavy platforms
- Teams experiencing RPC instability or rate limits

--- 
znode is infrastructure for teams that care about
**reliability over hype** and **engineering over marketing**.
